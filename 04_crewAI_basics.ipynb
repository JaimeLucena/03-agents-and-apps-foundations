    "\n",
    "**CrewAI** is a framework for orchestrating **multiple AI agents** that collaborate to achieve a goal. Each **Agent** has a role, a backstory, skills (tools), and a goal. A **Task** describes a piece of work assigned to an agent. A **Crew** coordinates agents and tasks, choosing a **Process** (sequential or hierarchical) to execute the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core concepts\n",
    "- **Agent** → A role-driven LLM with a goal and (optionally) tools.\n",
    "- **Task** → A unit of work with a clear objective and acceptance criteria.\n",
    "- **Crew** → The orchestrator that runs tasks with agents.\n",
    "- **Process** → How the crew executes (e.g., `sequential`, `hierarchical`).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Think of CrewAI as a way to make LLMs **collaborate** with clear responsibilities."
